##Compiler Design – Basic Arithmetic Expression Evaluator (Task 4)

**Internship Task by CODTECH**
**Submitted by:** Archana Kumari
**Project:** A simple C++ compiler that can parse and evaluate basic arithmetic expressions such as `3 + 5 * (2 - 1)`.

---

## Project Description

This program is a basic demonstration of **compiler design concepts**, focusing on:

* Parsing arithmetic expressions
* Handling operator precedence
* Evaluating expressions using recursion
* Working without any external libraries

It takes expressions from the user and returns the calculated result.

---

## Features

* Accepts basic arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and parentheses `()`
* Error detection for invalid syntax
* Simple and clean console-based interface
* Easy to understand and modify

---

##  How to Run

Make sure you have **g++** installed. Open terminal and run:

```bash
g++ compiler_task4.cpp -o compiler_task4
./compiler_task4
```

Then input any arithmetic expression like:

```
(3 + 5) * 2 - 4 / 2
```

---

##  Sample Output

```
Enter an arithmetic expression: (3 + 4) * 2 - 6 / 2
Result: 11
```
